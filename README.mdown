HAR
===

Ruby library to work with and view HTTP archives. Very young. Not very useful yet.
This includes [harviewer](http://code.google.com/p/harviewer/), which can be launched through the "har" command.

Usage
=============

    HAR::Archive.from_string(json) #=> #<Har::Archive:0x5e7cac>
    HAR::Archive.from_file(path)   #=> #<Har::Archive:0x5e7cac>

Or from command the command line:

    har /path/to/some.har


Links

* [harviewer](http://code.google.com/p/harviewer/)

Todo
====

Validate against HAR schema instead of simply raising {Index,Key}Error.

Note on Patches/Pull Requests
=============================

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
